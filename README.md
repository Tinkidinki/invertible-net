# Neural Network

This repository implements a simple neural network from scratch, and tests and documents the same. 

The nuances of backpropagation are explained in this [blog post](https://tinkidinki.github.io/2020/12/20/yet-another-backpropagation-blogpost.html).

The actual neural network is present in the file `neural_network.py`.
Sufficient examples to learn how to use the network, as well as tests, are in the Jupyter notebook `Testing_neural_network.ipynb`

Feel free to comment on the blogpost as well as send PR's for improvement of this network.
